# Fashion MNIST Classification Project

This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. This implementation is provided in both **Python** and **R**.

## 1. Introduction

The **Fashion MNIST dataset** consists of grayscale images of 10 different types of clothing items, such as shirts, trousers, and shoes. The goal of this project is to create a CNN model that can accurately classify these images.

In this project, we will:
- Preprocess the data by normalizing it.
- Build and train a CNN model.
- Evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy metrics.
- Make predictions on new test images.

### Languages Supported
- **Python** (with TensorFlow and Keras)
- **R** (with TensorFlow via the `keras` and `tensorflow` packages)

- **Python 3.x** (at least version 3.6)
- The following Python libraries:
  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
  - Matplotlib
  - Numpy

### For R:
- **R 4.x**
- The following R packages:
  - `keras`
  - `tensorflow`
  - `ggplot2` (optional, for plotting)
  - `reticulate` (to link Python and TensorFlow)

## 3. Setup Instructions

### Python Setup Instructions

1. **Set up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - To create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv fashion-mnist-env
     source fashion-mnist-env/Scripts/activate  # For Windows
     ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Once the virtual environment is activated, install the necessary Python libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy
     ```

3. **Run Python Code**:
   - Save the Python code provided below in a file named `fashion_mnist.py`.
   - Run the script in your terminal or VS Code:
     ```bash
     python fashion_mnist.py
     ```

### R Setup Instructions

1. **Install Required R Packages**:
   - Open an R terminal or R Interactive in VS Code and run the following to install the required packages:
     ```r
     install.packages("keras")
     install.packages("tensorflow")
     install.packages("ggplot2")  # Optional for plotting
     ```

2. **Configure TensorFlow for R**:
   - After installing the packages, configure TensorFlow in R by running:
     ```r
     library(keras)
     install_tensorflow()
     ```

3. **Run R Code**:
   - Save the R code provided below in a file named `fashion_mnist.R`.
   - Run the script in your R environment or VS Code.

## 4. Expected Output

After running the Python or R scripts, you should expect the following output:

1. **Training History Plot**: 
   - You will see a graph that shows the model’s training accuracy and validation accuracy across the number of epochs you’ve run (typically 10).
   - The plot will help visualize whether the model is learning effectively over time and whether there is any overfitting or underfitting.

2. **Predictions**:
   - The model will predict the classes (clothing items) for images from the test set.
   - You will see the predicted labels (such as "Shirt", "Shoe", etc.) for the first two test images printed out.
   - Example output:
     ```
     Prediction for first image: 2
     Prediction for second image: 5
     ```
   - These values represent the index of the class predicted by the model (e.g., 2 might correspond to "Pullover", and 5 might correspond to "Sandal").

## 5. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Python Environment Issues**:
   - If you encounter errors related to missing modules, ensure that Python 3.x is installed and accessible.
   - You can check this by running:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```
   - Ensure all required libraries are installed using `pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy`.

2. **TensorFlow Installation in R**:
   - If TensorFlow is not detected in R, try reinstalling it using the following command:
     ```r
     install_tensorflow()
     ```
   - Make sure to run `library(keras)` before configuring TensorFlow.

3. **VS Code Configuration**:
   - Ensure you have the appropriate extensions installed for **Python** and **R** if you are using VS Code.
   - For R, install the **R Tools** extension, and for Python, ensure the **Python** extension is enabled.

4. **Permission Denied or Package Issues in R**:
   - If you get a "Permission Denied" error in R while installing TensorFlow or Keras, try restarting R or VS Code and then reinstalling the `keras` and `reticulate` packages.

5. **Virtual Environment Issues in Python**:
   - If you are using a virtual environment and encounter issues, deactivate the environment and reactivate it using:
     ```bash
     source fashion-mnist-env/Scripts/activate
     ```
   - Make sure that you are running the code inside the activated virtual environment.

## 6. Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build a simple yet effective CNN for image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The steps include:
- Preprocessing the dataset for model input.
- Building and training a CNN model to recognize patterns in images.
- Evaluating the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy.
- Making predictions on new, unseen images.

This project helps you understand the core concepts of CNNs and how to implement them for image classification tasks using both **Python** and **R**. By following the steps and troubleshooting any errors, you should be able to successfully run the Fashion MNIST classification in your environment.
